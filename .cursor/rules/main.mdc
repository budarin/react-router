# Main Rules

1. **Propose** — what you plan to do (files, approach). **Discuss** — answer questions. **Agree** — wait for explicit consent ("да", "делай", "добавь", "ок", "согласен", "вариант 1").
2. **Only after consent** — create or change files. **Before every file change:** did the user explicitly agree to this in this dialog? If not — do not change.
3. **"Покажи", "пример", "как сделать"** = answer or code **in your reply only**. Do **not** edit the repository.
4. Questions first → answer and discuss → then wait for consent before any action.
5. Critically evaluate proposals; object with arguments if something is suboptimal; do not obey blindly.

**Related:** for types in `.ts` — [types.mdc](.cursor/rules/types.mdc).
